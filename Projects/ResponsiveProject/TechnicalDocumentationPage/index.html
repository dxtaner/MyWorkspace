            A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the
            Unix/Linux shell which could be one of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Bourne Shell</li>
            <li>The C Shell</li>
            <li>The Korn Shell</li>
            <li>The GNU Bourne-Again Shell</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A shell is a command-line interpreter and typical operations
            performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program
            execution, and printing text.

          <p>
            Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs,
            and shell scripts. There are different flavors of a shell, just as
            there are different flavors of operating systems. Each flavor of
            shell has its own set of recognized commands and functions.
          </p>
          <h4>Shell Prompt</h4>
          <p>
            The prompt, $, which is called the command prompt, is issued by the
            shell. While the prompt is displayed, you can type a command.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shell reads your input after you press Enter. It determines the
            command you want executed by looking at the first word of your
            input. A word is an unbroken set of characters. Spaces and tabs
            separate words.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following is a simple example of the date command, which displays
            the current date and time
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
            $date 
            Thu Jan 26 13:11:19 MST 2023 
            </code>

          <p>
            A variable is a character string to which we assign a value. The
            value assigned could be a number, text, filename, device, or any
            other type of data.
          </p>
          <h4>Variable Names</h4>
          <p>
            The name of a variable can contain only letters (a to z or A to Z),
            numbers ( 0 to 9) or the underscore character ( _ ).
          </p>
          <p>The following examples are valid variable names -</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                _ALI
                TOKEN_A
                VAR_1
                VAR_2
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Following are the examples of invalid variable names -</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                2_VAR
                -VARIABLE
                VAR1-VAR2
                VAR_A!
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            The reason you cannot use other characters such as !, *, or - is
            that these characters have a special meaning for the shell.
          </p>
          <h4>Accessing Values</h4>
          <p>
            To access the value stored in a variable, prefix its name with the
            dollar sign ($)
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #! /bin/sh

                GREETING="Hello World"
                echo $GREETING
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>The above script will produce the following value -</p>
          <code> Hello World </code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Special_Variables">
        <header>Special Variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In one of our previous chapters, we understood how to be careful
            when we use certain nonalphanumeric characters in variable names.
            This is because those characters are used in the names of special
            Unix variables. These variables are reserved for specific functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following list shows a number of special variables that you can
            use in your shell scripts -
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>$0 &#8594; The filename of the current script</li>
            <li>$# &#8594; The number of arguments supplied to a script.</li>
            <li>$? &#8594; The exit status of the last command executed.</li>
            <li>
              $$ &#8594; The process number of the current shell. For shell
              scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.
            </li>
            <li>
              $! &#8594; The process number of the last background command.
            </li>
            <li>
              $@ &#8594; All the arguments are individually double quoted. If a
              script receives two arguments, $@ is equivalent to $1 $2.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Shell supports a different type of variable called an array
            variable. This can hold multiple values at the same time. Arrays
            provide a method of grouping a set of variables. Instead of creating
            a new name for each variable that is required, you can use a single
            array variable that stores all the other variables.
          </p>
          <h4>Defining Array Values</h4>
          <p>
            Suppose you are trying to represent the names of various students as
            a set of variables. Each of the individual variables is a scalar
            variable as follows −
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                NAME01="Oliver"
                NAME03="Florence"
                NAME04="Oscar"
                NAME05="Olivia"
                NAME02="Harry"
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            We can use a single array to store all the above mentioned names.
            Following is the simplest method of creating an array variable. This
            helps assign a value to one of its indices.
          </p>
          <code> array_name[index]=value </code>
          <p>
            Here <var>array_name</var> is the name of the array, index is the
            index of the item in the array that you want to set, and value is
            the value you want to set for that item.
          </p>
          <p>As an example, the following commands −</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                NAME[0]="Oliver"
                NAME[1]="Florence"
                NAME[2]="Oscar"
                NAME[3]="Olivia"
                NAME[4]="Harry"
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h4>Accessing Array Values</h4>
          <p>
            After you have set any array variable, you access it as follows −
          </p>
          <code>${array_name[index]}</code>
          <p>
            Here <var>array_name</var> is the name of the array, and
            <var>index</var> is the index of the value to be accessed. Following
            is an example to understand the concept −
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                NAME[0]="Oliver"
                NAME[1]="Florence"
                NAME[2]="Oscar"
                NAME[3]="Olivia"
                NAME[4]="Harry"
                echo "First Index: ${NAME[0]}"
                echo "Second Index: ${NAME[1]}"
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>The above example will generate the following result −</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                First Index: Oliver
                Second Index: Florence
            </code>

            Bourne shell didn't originally have any mechanism to perform simple
            arithmetic operations but it uses external programs, either
            <b>awk</b> or <b>expr</b>.
          </p>
          <p>The following example shows how to add two numbers −</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

                val=`expr 2 + 2`
                echo "Total value : $val"
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>The above script will generate the following result −</p>
          <code>Total value : 4</code>
          <h4>Arithmetic Operators</h4>
          <p>
            The following arithmetic operators are supported by Bourne Shell
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>+ (Addition)</li>
            <li>- (Subtraction)</li>
            <li>* (Multiplication)</li>
            <li>/ (Division)</li>
            <li>% (Modulus)</li>
            <li>= (Assignment)</li>
            <li>== (Equality</li>
            <li>!= (Not Equality</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Relational Operators</h4>
          <p>
            Bourne Shell supports the following relational operators that are
            specific to numeric values. These operators do not work for string
            values unless their value is numeric.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>-eq (Equal)</li>
            <li>-ne (Not equal)</li>
            <li>-gt (Greater than)</li>
            <li>-lt (Less than)</li>
            <li>-ge (Greater than or equal)</li>
            <li>-le (Less than or equal)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Boolean Operators</h4>
          <p>
            The following Boolean operators are supported by the Bourne Shell.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>! (Not)</li>
            <li>-o (Or)</li>
            <li>-a (And)</li>

            While writing a shell script, there may be a situation when you need
            to adopt one path out of the given two paths. So you need to make
            use of conditional statements that allow your program to make
            correct decisions and perform the right actions.
          </p>
          <h4>The if...else statements</h4>
          <p>
            If else statements are useful decision-making statements which can
            be used to select an option from a given set of options.
          </p>
          <h5>Syntax</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                if [ expression 1 ]
                then
                   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 1 is true
                elif [ expression 2 ]
                then
                   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 2 is true
                elif [ expression 3 ]
                then
                   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 3 is true
                else
                   Statement(s) to be executed if no expression is true
                fi
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This code is just a series of if statements, where each if is part
            of the else clause of the previous statement. Here statement(s) are
            executed based on the true condition, if none of the condition is
            true then else block is executed.
          </p>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

                a=10
                b=20

                if [ $a == $b ]
                then
                   echo "a is equal to b"
                elif [ $a -gt $b ]
                then
                   echo "a is greater than b"
                elif [ $a -lt $b ]
                then
                   echo "a is less than b"
                else
                   echo "None of the condition met"
                fi
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result -</p>
          <code>a is less than b</code>
          <h4>The case...esac statement</h4>
          <p>
            You can use multiple <b>if...elif</b> statements to perform a
            multiway branch. However, this is not always the best solution,
            especially when all of the branches depend on the value of a single
            variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shell supports <b>case...esac</b> statement which handles exactly
            this situation, and it does so more efficiently than repeated
            if...elif statements
          </p>
          <h5>Syntax</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                case word in
                 pattern1)
                    Statement(s) to be executed if pattern1 matches
                    ;;
                 pattern2)
                    Statement(s) to be executed if pattern2 matches
                    ;;
                 pattern3)
                    Statement(s) to be executed if pattern3 matches
                    ;;
                 *)
                    Default condition to be executed
                    ;;
                esac
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Here the string word is compared against every pattern until a match
            is found. The statement(s) following the matching pattern executes.
            If no matches are found, the case statement exits without performing
            any action.
          </p>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

            A loop is a powerful programming tool that enables you to execute a
            set of commands repeatedly. In this chapter, we will examine the
            while and for loop.
          </p>
          <h4>While Loop</h4>
          <p>The syntax is as follows:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                while [ condition ]
                do
                   command1
                   command2
                   command3
                done
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/bash

                x=1
                while [ $x -le 5 ]
                do
                echo "Welcome $x times"
                x=$(( $x + 1 ))
                done
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>You will receive the following result -</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                Welcome 1 times
                Welcome 2 times
                Welcome 3 times
                Welcome 4 times
                Welcome 5 times
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h4>For Loop</h4>
          <p>
            The for loop operates on lists of items. It repeats a set of
            commands for every item in a list.
          </p>
          <h5>Syntax</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                for var in word1 word2 ... wordN
                do
                     Statement(s) to be executed for every word.
                done
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Here <var>var</var> is the name of a variable and word1 to wordN are
            sequences of characters separated by spaces (words). Each time the
            for loop executes, the value of the variable var is set to the next
            word in the list of words, word1 to wordN.
          </p>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <p>
            Here is a simple example that uses the for loop to span through the
            given list of numbers −
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

                for var in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
                do
                    echo $var
                done    
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result -</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                0
                1
                2
                3
                4
                5
                6
                7
                8
                9

        <article>
          <p>
            In this chapter, we will discuss shell loop control in Unix. So far
            you have looked at creating loops and working with loops to
            accomplish different tasks. Sometimes you need to stop a loop or
            skip iterations of the loop.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this chapter, we will learn following two statements that are
            used to control shell loops -
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <b>break</b> statement</li>
            <li>The <b>continue</b> statement</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>The break Statement</h4>
          <p>
            The break statement is used to terminate the execution of the entire
            loop, after completing the execution of all of the lines of code up
            to the break statement. It then steps down to the code following the
            end of the loop.
          </p>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

                a=0

                while [ $a -lt 10 ]
                do
                   echo $a
                   if [ $a -eq 5 ]
                   then
                      break
                   fi
                   a=`expr $a + 1`
                done
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result -</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                0
                1
                2
                3
                4
                5
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h4>The continue Statement</h4>
          <p>
            The <b>continue</b> statement is similar to the
            <b>break</b> command, except that it causes the current iteration of
            the loop to exit, rather than the entire loop.
          </p>
          <p>
            This statement is useful when an error has occurred but you want to
            try to execute the next iteration of the loop.
          </p>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

                NUMS="1 2 3 4 5 6 7"

                for NUM in $NUMS
                do
                   Q=`expr $NUM % 2`
                   if [ $Q -eq 0 ]
                   then
                      echo "Number is an even number!!"
                      continue
                   fi
                   echo "Found odd number"
                done
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result −</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                Found odd number
                Number is an even number!!
                Found odd number
                Number is an even number!!
                Found odd number
                Number is an even number!!
                Found odd number

          <p>
            In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about the shell
            functions. Functions enable you to break down the overall
            functionality of a script into smaller, logical subsections, which
            can then be called upon to perform their individual tasks when
            needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using functions to perform repetitive tasks is an excellent way to
            create code reuse. This is an important part of modern
            object-oriented programming principles.
          </p>
          <h4>Creating Functions</h4>
          <p>To declare a function, simply use the following syntax −</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                function_name () { 
                    list of commands
                }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            The name of your function is <b>function_name</b>, and that's what
            you will use to call it from elsewhere in your scripts. The function
            name must be followed by parentheses, followed by a list of commands
            enclosed within braces.
          </p>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

                # Define your function here
                Hello () {
                   echo "Hello World"
                }

                # Invoke your function
                Hello
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Upon execution, you will receive the following output −</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                $./test.sh
                Hello World
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h4>Pass Parameters to a Function</h4>
          <p>
            You can define a function that will accept parameters while calling
            the function. These parameters would be represented by <b>$1</b>,
            <b>$2</b> and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following is an example where we pass two parameters
            <i>Taner</i> and <i>Özer</i>
            and then we capture and print these parameters in the function.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                !/bin/sh

                # Define your function here
                Hello () {
                   echo "Hello $1 $2"
                }

                # Invoke your function
                Hello Taner Özer
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result −</p>
          <code>Hello Taner Özer</code>

            A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the
            Unix/Linux shell which could be one of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Bourne Shell</li>
            <li>The C Shell</li>
            <li>The Korn Shell</li>
            <li>The GNU Bourne-Again Shell</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A shell is a command-line interpreter and typical operations
            performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program
            execution, and printing text.
          </p>

        <header>What is Shell?</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs,
            and shell scripts. There are different flavors of a shell, just as
            there are different flavors of operating systems. Each flavor of
            shell has its own set of recognized commands and functions.
          </p>
          <h4>Shell Prompt</h4>
          <p>
            The prompt, $, which is called the command prompt, is issued by the
            shell. While the prompt is displayed, you can type a command.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shell reads your input after you press Enter. It determines the
            command you want executed by looking at the first word of your
            input. A word is an unbroken set of characters. Spaces and tabs
            separate words.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following is a simple example of the date command, which displays
            the current date and time
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
            $date 
            Thu Jan 26 13:11:19 MST 2023 
            </code>

        <header>Variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            A variable is a character string to which we assign a value. The
            value assigned could be a number, text, filename, device, or any
            other type of data.
          </p>
          <h4>Variable Names</h4>
          <p>
            The name of a variable can contain only letters (a to z or A to Z),
            numbers ( 0 to 9) or the underscore character ( _ ).
          </p>
          <p>The following examples are valid variable names -</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                _ALI
                TOKEN_A
                VAR_1
                VAR_2
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Following are the examples of invalid variable names -</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                2_VAR
                -VARIABLE
                VAR1-VAR2
                VAR_A!
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            The reason you cannot use other characters such as !, *, or - is
            that these characters have a special meaning for the shell.
          </p>
          <h4>Accessing Values</h4>
          <p>
            To access the value stored in a variable, prefix its name with the
            dollar sign ($)
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #! /bin/sh

                GREETING="Hello World"
                echo $GREETING
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>The above script will produce the following value -</p>
          <code> Hello World </code>

        <article>
          <p>
            In one of our previous chapters, we understood how to be careful
            when we use certain nonalphanumeric characters in variable names.
            This is because those characters are used in the names of special
            Unix variables. These variables are reserved for specific functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following list shows a number of special variables that you can
            use in your shell scripts -
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>$0 &#8594; The filename of the current script</li>
            <li>$# &#8594; The number of arguments supplied to a script.</li>
            <li>$? &#8594; The exit status of the last command executed.</li>
            <li>
              $$ &#8594; The process number of the current shell. For shell
              scripts, this is the process ID under which they are executing.
            </li>
            <li>
              $! &#8594; The process number of the last background command.
            </li>
            <li>
              $@ &#8594; All the arguments are individually double quoted. If a
              script receives two arguments, $@ is equivalent to $1 $2.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <article>
          <p>
            Shell supports a different type of variable called an array
            variable. This can hold multiple values at the same time. Arrays
            provide a method of grouping a set of variables. Instead of creating
            a new name for each variable that is required, you can use a single
            array variable that stores all the other variables.
          </p>
          <h4>Defining Array Values</h4>
          <p>
            Suppose you are trying to represent the names of various students as
            a set of variables. Each of the individual variables is a scalar
            variable as follows −
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                NAME01="Oliver"
                NAME03="Florence"
                NAME04="Oscar"
                NAME05="Olivia"
                NAME02="Harry"
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            We can use a single array to store all the above mentioned names.
            Following is the simplest method of creating an array variable. This
            helps assign a value to one of its indices.
          </p>
          <code> array_name[index]=value </code>
          <p>
            Here <var>array_name</var> is the name of the array, index is the
            index of the item in the array that you want to set, and value is
            the value you want to set for that item.
          </p>
          <p>As an example, the following commands −</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                NAME[0]="Oliver"
                NAME[1]="Florence"
                NAME[2]="Oscar"
                NAME[3]="Olivia"
                NAME[4]="Harry"
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h4>Accessing Array Values</h4>
          <p>
            After you have set any array variable, you access it as follows −
          </p>
          <code>${array_name[index]}</code>
          <p>
            Here <var>array_name</var> is the name of the array, and
            <var>index</var> is the index of the value to be accessed. Following
            is an example to understand the concept −
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                NAME[0]="Oliver"
                NAME[1]="Florence"
                NAME[2]="Oscar"
                NAME[3]="Olivia"
                NAME[4]="Harry"
                echo "First Index: ${NAME[0]}"
                echo "Second Index: ${NAME[1]}"
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>The above example will generate the following result −</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                First Index: Oliver
                Second Index: Florence
            </code>

            Bourne shell didn't originally have any mechanism to perform simple
            arithmetic operations but it uses external programs, either
            <b>awk</b> or <b>expr</b>.
          </p>
          <p>The following example shows how to add two numbers −</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

                val=`expr 2 + 2`
                echo "Total value : $val"
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>The above script will generate the following result −</p>
          <code>Total value : 4</code>
          <h4>Arithmetic Operators</h4>
          <p>
            The following arithmetic operators are supported by Bourne Shell
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>+ (Addition)</li>
            <li>- (Subtraction)</li>
            <li>* (Multiplication)</li>
            <li>/ (Division)</li>
            <li>% (Modulus)</li>
            <li>= (Assignment)</li>
            <li>== (Equality</li>
            <li>!= (Not Equality</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Relational Operators</h4>
          <p>
            Bourne Shell supports the following relational operators that are
            specific to numeric values. These operators do not work for string
            values unless their value is numeric.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>-eq (Equal)</li>
            <li>-ne (Not equal)</li>
            <li>-gt (Greater than)</li>
            <li>-lt (Less than)</li>
            <li>-ge (Greater than or equal)</li>
            <li>-le (Less than or equal)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Boolean Operators</h4>
          <p>
            The following Boolean operators are supported by the Bourne Shell.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>! (Not)</li>
            <li>-o (Or)</li>

            While writing a shell script, there may be a situation when you need
            to adopt one path out of the given two paths. So you need to make
            use of conditional statements that allow your program to make
            correct decisions and perform the right actions.
          </p>
          <h4>The if...else statements</h4>
          <p>
            If else statements are useful decision-making statements which can
            be used to select an option from a given set of options.
          </p>
          <h5>Syntax</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                if [ expression 1 ]
                then
                   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 1 is true
                elif [ expression 2 ]
                then
                   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 2 is true
                elif [ expression 3 ]
                then
                   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 3 is true

            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This code is just a series of if statements, where each if is part
            of the else clause of the previous statement. Here statement(s) are
            executed based on the true condition, if none of the condition is
            true then else block is executed.
          </p>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

                a=10
                b=20

                if [ $a == $b ]
                then
                   echo "a is equal to b"
                elif [ $a -gt $b ]
                then

                fi
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result -</p>
          <code>a is less than b</code>
          <h4>The case...esac statement</h4>
          <p>
            You can use multiple <b>if...elif</b> statements to perform a
            multiway branch. However, this is not always the best solution,
            especially when all of the branches depend on the value of a single
            variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shell supports <b>case...esac</b> statement which handles exactly
            this situation, and it does so more efficiently than repeated
            if...elif statements
          </p>
          <h5>Syntax</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                case word in

                 pattern2)
                    Statement(s) to be executed if pattern2 matches

            Here the string word is compared against every pattern until a match
            is found. The statement(s) following the matching pattern executes.
            If no matches are found, the case statement exits without performing
            any action.

            A loop is a powerful programming tool that enables you to execute a
            set of commands repeatedly. In this chapter, we will examine the
            while and for loop.
          </p>
          <h4>While Loop</h4>
          <p>The syntax is as follows:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                while [ condition ]
                do
                   command1
                   command2
                   command3
                done
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/bash

                x=1
                while [ $x -le 5 ]
                do
                echo "Welcome $x times"
                x=$(( $x + 1 ))
                done
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>You will receive the following result -</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                Welcome 1 times
                Welcome 2 times
                Welcome 3 times
                Welcome 4 times
                Welcome 5 times
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h4>For Loop</h4>
          <p>
            The for loop operates on lists of items. It repeats a set of
            commands for every item in a list.
          </p>
          <h5>Syntax</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                for var in word1 word2 ... wordN
                do
                     Statement(s) to be executed for every word.
                done
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Here <var>var</var> is the name of a variable and word1 to wordN are
            sequences of characters separated by spaces (words). Each time the
            for loop executes, the value of the variable var is set to the next
            word in the list of words, word1 to wordN.
          </p>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <p>
            Here is a simple example that uses the for loop to span through the
            given list of numbers −
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

                for var in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
                do
                    echo $var
                done    
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result -</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                0

          <p>
            In this chapter, we will discuss shell loop control in Unix. So far
            you have looked at creating loops and working with loops to
            accomplish different tasks. Sometimes you need to stop a loop or
            skip iterations of the loop.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this chapter, we will learn following two statements that are
            used to control shell loops -
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <b>break</b> statement</li>
            <li>The <b>continue</b> statement</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>The break Statement</h4>
          <p>
            The break statement is used to terminate the execution of the entire
            loop, after completing the execution of all of the lines of code up
            to the break statement. It then steps down to the code following the
            end of the loop.
          </p>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

                a=0

                while [ $a -lt 10 ]
                do
                   echo $a
                   if [ $a -eq 5 ]
                   then
                      break
                   fi
                   a=`expr $a + 1`
                done
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result -</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                0
                1
                2
                3
                4
                5
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h4>The continue Statement</h4>
          <p>
            The <b>continue</b> statement is similar to the
            <b>break</b> command, except that it causes the current iteration of
            the loop to exit, rather than the entire loop.
          </p>
          <p>
            This statement is useful when an error has occurred but you want to
            try to execute the next iteration of the loop.
          </p>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

                NUMS="1 2 3 4 5 6 7"

                for NUM in $NUMS
                do
                   Q=`expr $NUM % 2`
                   if [ $Q -eq 0 ]
                   then
                      echo "Number is an even number!!"
                      continue
                   fi
                   echo "Found odd number"
                done
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result −</p>

            In this chapter, we will discuss in detail about the shell
            functions. Functions enable you to break down the overall
            functionality of a script into smaller, logical subsections, which
            can then be called upon to perform their individual tasks when
            needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using functions to perform repetitive tasks is an excellent way to
            create code reuse. This is an important part of modern
            object-oriented programming principles.
          </p>
          <h4>Creating Functions</h4>
          <p>To declare a function, simply use the following syntax −</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                function_name () { 
                    list of commands
                }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            The name of your function is <b>function_name</b>, and that's what
            you will use to call it from elsewhere in your scripts. The function
            name must be followed by parentheses, followed by a list of commands
            enclosed within braces.
          </p>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <pre>
            <code>
                #!/bin/sh

                # Define your function here
                Hello () {
                   echo "Hello World"
                }

                # Invoke your function
                Hello
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Upon execution, you will receive the following output −</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                $./test.sh
                Hello World
            </code>
          </pre>
          <h4>Pass Parameters to a Function</h4>
          <p>
            You can define a function that will accept parameters while calling
            the function. These parameters would be represented by <b>$1</b>,
            <b>$2</b> and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following is an example where we pass two parameters
            <i>Taner</i> and <i>Özer</i>
            and then we capture and print these parameters in the function.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
                !/bin/sh

                # Define your function here
                Hello () {
                   echo "Hello $1 $2"
                }

                # Invoke your function
                Hello Taner Özer
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Upon execution, you will receive the following result −</p>
          <code>Hello Taner Özer</code>
