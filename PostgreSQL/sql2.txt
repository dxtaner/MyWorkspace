There is a table Expenses with the following columns and example data in it.
monthNumber| weekNumber | expense
month01      week01       12
month01       week02       21
month01       week03       33
month01        week04    18
month02    week01          35
month02     week02          27

Write an SQL query to output each month's average expense according to weeks in descending order of month Number, with decimals of 2 numbers.
For example, according to the above table, we should output:
monthNumber | avg_expense |
month02        31.00


SELECT
    monthNumber,
    ROUND(AVG(expense), 2) AS avg_expense
FROM
    Expenses
GROUP BY
    monthNumber
ORDER BY
    monthNumber DESC;
