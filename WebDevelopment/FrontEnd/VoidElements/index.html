  Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical
  physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all
  time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he
  also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum
  mechanics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc² has been dubbed "the
  world's most famous equation".

  He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical
  physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
  effect. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word
  "Einstein" synonymous with genius.
